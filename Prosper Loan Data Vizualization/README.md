# Loan Prosper Dataset Investigation
## by Chelsea Moore


## Dataset

> The data consists of information about 113,937 loans granted by Prosper. This includes the Prosper score, listing category (loan type), employment status, number of current credit lines, number of open revolving accounts, debt to income ratio, and original loan amount. The list is extensive.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found that most loans were taken out for debt consolidation and that majority of borrowers were employed and earning an income. To understand the loan data in more detail, I performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. These techniques helped get a good understainf of the existing distribution and relationships in the dataset. My analysis focused on the relationships between variables and the prosper score (how risky the loan is)& interest APR.

> From the variables that I analysed, there was a medium to strong relationship with the prosper score and the interest rate APR. This indicated that the higher the prosper score (less risky), the better the interest rate. I also found that there was a medium negative relationship between the loan amount and the interest rate APR - this means that the bigger the loan amount, the better the interest rate was. Being employed did not have a significant on the interest rate, however if one was not employed, they paid on average a higher interest rate. Factors like being a home owner did not influence a better interest rate, however, home owners were able to take out slightly bigger loans than non-homeowners.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Overall, the Prosper score is a great way to assess the riskiness of the applicant and have an influence on the Interest Rate the borrower will receive. The less risky an application is, the better the interest rate. However, I think it is important to further this investigation to asses the effect of the term of the loan has on the Prosper Score, if the income is verifiable and how many credit lines the applicant has open.
