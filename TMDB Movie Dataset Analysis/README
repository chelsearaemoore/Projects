# TMDB Movie Dataset

## Introduction

This project takes a look at the TMDb Dataset. The dataset set contains information for over 10 000 movies 1960 and 2015. Data in the dataset ranges from the cast, directors, budget, revenue, movie ratings, genres and more. This dataset opens up opportunities to analyse and understand the performance of movies over the last 56 years.

This project aims to clean the dataset, conduct exploratory data analysis and make tentative conclusions based on the EDA.

Questions that will be answered:

Which were the top 10 movies based on revenue & profit?
How has profit changed over the past 56 years?
Which were the bottom 10 movies which lost money?
Is there a relationship between vote_average and profit?
Is there a relationship between budget & profit?
Is there a relationship between runtime & profit?
Is there a relationship between revenue & profit?

## Summmary & Conclusions

### Results

Overall, the top movies based on profit and revenue were:

Star Wars, Avatar & Titanic. With Stars top for profit while Avatar had the top revenue.

Over the last 56 year, especially since 1975, the profit movies have generated has increased substantially, with the top year being 2011.

The bottom movie, with the highest loss (negative profit) was "The Warrior's Way", with a substantial loss.

There is also slight positive relationship (correlations) between: Vote_average and profit Budget and profit Runtime and profit

Strong positive relationship between: Revenue and profit

However, these are not statistical tests and not conclusions can be made until statistical tests have been run.

## Limitations
Most attributes were categorical data, which limits the number of correlations and statistical tests one can make.
The analysis conduted was exploratory and used descriptive statistics, no statistical tests were conducted and no inferences (conclusions) can be made from the results.
There was quite a bit of missing data and data with with zero values which had to be excluded from the analysis.
The order the actors were listed was acording to the order they appeared on the credits, which could differ in mthodology between films.
